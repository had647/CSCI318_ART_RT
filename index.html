		<h3>Assessment 1 - FSCS-ART algorithm for a two-dimensional input space</h3>
		<div class="divider"></div>
		<p><b>Description: </b>In this progress report, you implement ART and RT test case
generation algorithms and submit a demo to show the competition of these two
algorithms to see who can more quickly detect a failure (that is, hit the failure
region) by using a fewer number of test cases. You need to first read the papers in
the “Readings/Adaptive Random Testing” folder in Moodle, and then implement the
FSCS-ART algorithm for a two-dimensional input space.</p>

		<h3>Assessment 2 - ART and RT with OOP</h3>
		<div class="divider"></div>
		<p><b>Description: </b>Read “Readings/Adaptive Random Testing” folder in Moodle to
understand the methods of applying ART to programs with non-numerical inputs.
Then choose one of these approaches (or design your own ART method) to
implement. In other words, you need to develop a software testing tool by
implementing an ART method of your choice so that your tool can be used to test
non-numerical programs. The target users of your tool will be programmers who
want to conduct either black- or white-box testing of their programs. You need to
design the functional specification and user interface of your tool. It could be either a
graphical or command-line user interface, although the former is preferred. You
should submit a prototype of your tool, including the source code, executable code, a
user manual, and a PPT demo that includes some screenshots to show the key
features of your tool.</p>
